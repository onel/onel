## 👋 Hi, I'm Andrei

- 📝 I’ve recently started a [substack](https://anonel.substack.com/) where I write about startups, tech and AI.
- ❤️ I get involved in AI and civic tech projects.
- 🐱 I also build software for when my cat [takes over my keyboard](https://github.com/onel/keyboard-cat-defense).
- 💬 If you want to talk about open models, AI or RAG I'm buying 🍻.
